In this project, we were given an Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scanning of the retina. Our task was to count the number of photoreceptors and create a quantity map.
We were also asked to simulate a disease image in which some of these photoreceptors are randomly selected and destroyed in a localized region, mimicking the effect of a disease.
 to present the quantity map in a local region.
